    "No ambient noise (e.g., appliances, crowds, outdoor city sounds) inconsistent with scene\u2014naturalistic room tone, environmental detail only as specified.",

    "No jump scares, horror cues, comedic accents, sentimental swells, or emotionally manipulative musical climaxes.",
    "No overlapping dialogue or TTS lines during moments of peak audio; musical motifs must duck to preserve spoken clarity."

For simulation breakdowns (notably shot s4), introduce abrupt digital glitch textures and cold, synthetic pulses, using defined distortion effects and a sudden transient or processed noise. For clinical/control scenes, music shifts to hollow, sterile textures, with absence of warmth. All transitions are gradual and restrained. At final shots, theme returns but is faded and subtly synthetic, never sentimental or lush.",
