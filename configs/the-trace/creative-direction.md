# Creative Direction - THE TRACE (Stranger Things x Fallout)

## One-liner
1980s American high school, filmed like a premium genre series: warm nostalgia + eerie control.
The school behaves like a living system; "pulses" are the unseen rule.
Contrast = the new girl who leaves a trace.

## Mood keywords (10)
Analog nostalgia, fluorescent dread, suburban night, locker-hum, chlorine echo, emergency red, clinical calm, ritual repetition, hidden lesion, premium cinematic polish.

## World & Setting (must read "America" instantly)
- Hallways: long locker corridors, trophy case, letterman jackets, flyers on cork boards, vending machines, payphone corner, janitor cart.
- Pool: tiled walls, lane ropes, muffled PA announcements, wet footprints, chlorine haze.
- Gym: hardwood floor, banners, pep practice energy.
- Dance wing: glass-walled studio, mirrored wall, squeaky ballet barres.
- Old classroom: scuffed linoleum, stacked chairs, taped marks on the floor, dusty blinds.
- Radiology room (hard cut): quiet, clean, neutral, modern - contrast to school chaos.

## Cinematography grammar (Fallout-style polish)
### Shot motifs (repeat as "visual chorus")
1) Overhead top-downs: students as a moving current (bloodstream metaphor).
2) Macro inserts: Leyla's stained palm, wet tile grout, locker dents, pen scratching on clipboard.
3) Slow push-ins on "rule moments": the pulse, the red light, the first eye contact.
4) Wide symmetrical frames in controlled spaces (gym/studio) vs. drifting handheld in hallways.

### Lens kit (feel, not tech worship)
- 18-24mm: overhead hallway flows, pool geometry, gym formations.
- 35mm: "human scale" walking + group interactions.
- 50-85mm: emotional isolation, faces at the moment they finally "see" her.
- Macro: the metallic stain, fingertips, fabric fibers, condensation.

### Optical character
- Slight halation/bloom on highlights (neon/red emergency, fluorescents).
- Subtle chromatic aberration on edges during pulses (not glitchy).
- Texture: mild film grain + gate weave feel (controlled, not "dirty").

### Camera movement rules
- Hallways: floating drift / slow dolly feel, minimal shake.
- Pulses: micro-jerk + brief stabilization "snap back" (world corrects itself).
- Overheads: steady, almost clinical - like someone is measuring.

## Lighting & Color (two worlds)
### School (primary)
- Warm tungsten pockets (nostalgia) fighting cold greenish fluorescents (control).
- Shadows lean teal/blue; highlights can go amber.
- Emergency red is a narrative switch: when it appears, the system has "seen" something.

### Radiology (final beat)
- Neutral whites, soft shadows, low saturation, calm exposure.
- No stylized color; it should feel real and safe.

## Pulse language (how it looks without VFX overload)
- Environment reacts: flicker, ripple, tiny sway, a brief "push" through bodies.
- Sound bridge sells it: low thump + room tone shift.
- People recover at different speeds (the metric), but we never explain it overtly.

## Transitions (smooth, premium)
- Match cuts: pool ripple -> hallway fluorescent shimmer; locker slam -> door to studio; red light wash -> clinical white.
- Audio bridges: bell ring carries into the next space; pencil scratch carries over a cut.
- Rack focus transitions: foreground stain -> background panic; clipboard -> Leyla's face.
- Avoid "flashy" glitch transitions. Keep it cinematic.

## Production design notes (small details that sell 80s America)
- Color pops: varsity red, denim blue, mustard, faded teal.
- Props: Walkman headphones, spiral notebooks, Polaroid, CRT corner TV, school announcements speaker.
- Textures: worn paint, scuffed floors, condensation, chalk dust.

## References (5-10)
1) Stranger Things - high school hallway energy + 80s palette + lurking dread.
2) Stranger Things - pool / aquatic sequences (chlorine, echo, geometry).
3) Stranger Things - "rules of the world" shown visually, not explained.
4) Fallout (Amazon) - premium composition, confident lens choices, controlled camera.
5) Fallout - vault lighting: sterile order contrasted with human mess.
6) The Breakfast Club - authentic American school texture (lockers, gym, teen cadence).
7) Super 8 - suburban 80s mood, warm nostalgia with threat undertone.
8) Donnie Darko - school normality with uncanny pressure.
9) The Faculty - school setting with "body" paranoia vibe.
10) Carrie (gym sequences) - ritualized school space turning tense.

## Anti-references (3-5)
1) Sterile corporate commercial look (flat lighting, clean gradients, no texture).
2) TikTok/UGC aesthetics (over-sharp, jump cuts, "content" vibe).
3) MCU-style glossy CG (too shiny, weightless, over-stylized VFX).
4) Cyberpunk neon overload (turns it into a different genre).
5) Anime/illustrative stylization (breaks the grounded American-school realism).

## Figma deliverables (what the team builds)
### 1) Moodboard (1 frame)
- 20-30 images: lockers, pool tiles, emergency lights, 80s teen wardrobe, fluorescents, overhead hallway shots, vault-like symmetry.
- 6-8 color swatches with labels (School Warm / Fluoro Cold / Emergency Red / Radiology Neutral).
- 6 texture tiles (grain, scuffed linoleum, condensation, painted metal locker, chalk dust, glass reflections).

### 2) Style Tiles (1 frame)
- Typography pairing (Display + Body) + subtitle style.
- Buttons/labels if needed for any UI overlays: minimal, diegetic feel.
- Shadow/radius language: "premium but not app-y".
- Motion samples: fade, slow push, red-light state.

### 3) Key screens (2-3 frames)
A) "Hallway Overhead Flow" (top-down + locker geometry + bell moment).
B) "Red Light Classroom" (stain visibility + panic + alarm wash).
C) "Radiology Calm" (neutral clinical palette + final line).

## Shot Grammar Checklist (enforced)
### Coverage pattern per location (minimum)
- Pool: 1 wide geometry + 1 medium group + 1 macro (water/tile/hand).
- Hallway: 1 top-down flow + 1 medium drift with Leyla + 1 insert (lockers/clipboard/bell).
- Gym: 1 wide formation + 1 low-angle stability beat + 1 reaction close-up (optional).
- Ballet: 1 glass-wide + 1 tele close-up through reflections + 1 recovery beat on pulse.
- Old classroom: 1 wide chaos + 2 macros (stain + contact) + 1 red-alert wash beat.
- Radiology: 1 calm wide + 1 close-up + 1 doctor line (no stylized inserts).

### Lens language rules
- Wide (18-24): geometry + system moments only.
- Normal (35): default human movement.
- Tele (50-85): isolation and "seen" moments.
- Macro: stain + measurement fetish (hands, fibers, pen scratch, sweat on tile).

### Movement rules
- Drift (hallway): slow float, minimal shake.
- Locked-off (gym): control and stability.
- Controlled push for rule moments: pulse, first eye contact, red alert switch.
- Pulse micro-jerk only (0.2-0.4s), then snap back to stable.

### Transition rules
- Match cuts: ripple -> fluorescent shimmer; locker slam -> studio door; red wash -> clinical white.
- Audio bridges: bell/PA -> next location; pen scratch -> stain rub; thump -> room tone shift.
- Rack focus as invisible cut: foreground trace -> background panic.

### "America reads instantly" checks
- Lockers + trophies + banners appear at least once each.
- One exterior school-sports beat implied through sound or light.
- Wardrobe includes letterman/cheer/denim palette cues.

## Reference selector rules (for agents/pipeline)
### Selection policy per scene
- Select 1 location ref (`hallway`/`gym`/`pool`/`studio`/`old_classroom`/`radiology`).
- Select 1 shot-type ref (`topdown_flow`/`macro_stain`/`hero_group`/`telephoto_isolation`).
- Optional: add 1 light/color ref (`fluorescent`/`emergency_red`/`clinical_neutral`).

### Functional mapping
- `ref_stranger_things_hallway_group` -> hallway baseline (`hallway`, `lockers`, `fluorescent`, `ensemble`).
- `ref_stranger_things_letterman_team` -> hero-group practical mood (`symmetry_control`, `letterman`).
- `ref_cheer_gym_red_uniforms` -> gym performance (`cheerleaders`, `formation_stability`, `wide_group`).
- `ref_closeup_teal_jacket_outside` -> close-up tone (`telephoto_isolation`, `grounded_teen`).
- `ref_cheer_field_stunt_blue` -> outdoor America scale (`football_field`, `wide_scale`, `daylight`).
- `ref_football_walk_bleachers` -> bleachers/cars authenticity (`bleachers`, `jerseys`, `parking_lot`).

### Hard bans
- Radiology scenes ban: `neon_red`, `heavy_grain`, `stylized_halation`.
- Gym/Ballet scenes ban: `handheld_shaky` (allowed only in old classroom escalation).
- Pulse look ban: `digital_glitch`, `vhs_damage`.
