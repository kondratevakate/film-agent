## What the product/film should look and feel like
- Ink + warm paper baseline: even "bright" areas feel like paper, not sterile white.
- Rhythm first: the pluck is not background - it's causal. Scenes obey its beat.
- Contrast equals meaning: red and cyan exist only for story function (lure vs reveal).
- Geometry is magic: infinity is shown through repetition and axis tilt, not VFX noise.
- Silhouette clarity: characters read by shape and pose; motion is restrained and precise.
- Elegant menace: beauty should feel slightly wrong; danger is quiet until the reveal.

## What we do NOT do
- No cute/rounded "Pixar plastic" vibe.
- No neon cyberpunk glow-fests (RGB as decoration).
- No hyper-real 3D rendering without anime stylization.
- No chibi/comedic deformation during dramatic beats.
- No UI-heavy frames or tiny readable text (avoid infographics).
- No modern elements (no modern clothing, devices, signage, or props).
- Axis flips over VFX: surrealism comes from geometry and tilt, not particle-heavy magic.
