# PHYSICS RULES - Motion behavior for each room type
physics:
  global:
    rf_pulse_effect: "camera shake, lanterns swing violently, floor tilts momentarily"
    rf_pulse_triggers: ["shamisen pluck", "beat drop", "door slam"]
    ambient_motion: "gentle lantern sway, dust particles floating"

  rooms:
    glass_water_chamber:
      motion_style: "slow motion, synchronized swimming, graceful floating"
      movement_speed: 0.3  # 30% normal speed
      camera: "smooth dolly along glass wall, side view, no shake"
      environment: "synchronized swimmers in formation, bubbles trailing movements, light rays diffusing through water"
      physics_metaphor: "CSF fluid - coordinated slow movement through resistance"

    sumo_ring:
      motion_style: "heavy impact, multiple bodies colliding, ground shake on contact"
      movement_speed: 0.7  # deliberate, weighty
      camera: "low angle, slight shake on impacts, tracking wrestlers"
