    "A plucked castle string in the Infinity Castle drives full-body sway in large hydrogen crowds and causes the disorientation.",
    "An unmasked teenage Intruder (tanjiro-like original hero energy) wakes inside the castle and investigates why people are being pulled.",
    "Core metaphor map is explicit in separate beats: water is divers behind glass, fat is sumo mass, bone is tai chi and buddhist groups at a support pillar, and the hidden source is Geisha (Lure).",
    "MRI factual texture is explicit: T1 is longitudinal recovery time after excitation; water behaves longer-T1, fat behaves shorter-T1, and gadolinium shortens local T1 where it accumulates.",
    "Athlete rotation is intentional metaphor: circular motion around a fixed pillar represents spin precession around one magnetic field axis before realignment.",
    "Geisha (Lure) uses fan-timed rhythm to pull hydrogen people toward one central resource dais without explicit medical labeling before the end.",
    "Intruder enters the circle to connect with high-energy hydrogen groups; a gadolinium-contrast wrist mark converts collapse into synchronized stability and reveals hidden resource flow.",
    "Twist policy: before end credits there is no direct medical naming of tumor or glioblastoma; the explicit diagnosis appears only on the final end-card title text after the black-screen katana cut: \"Глиобластома выявлена и удалена.\""
