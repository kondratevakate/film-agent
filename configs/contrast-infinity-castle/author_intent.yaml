# Author Intent Configuration
# This file captures WHY we're making this video
# Every gate in the pipeline validates against this

project_id: contrast-infinity-castle

# Core Narrative
# What story am I telling?
core_narrative: |
  A young intruder navigates an impossible Japanese castle,
  where she discovers that the mysterious Geisha is manipulating
  everyone through synchronized movements. By understanding the
  castle's rules (MRI physics), she exposes the Geisha's control
  and breaks the spell.

# Audience Takeaway
# What should viewers feel/understand after watching?
audience_takeaway: |
  "Wow, MRI is fascinating - I want to learn more about how
  contrast agents reveal hidden structures in the brain."
  The viewer should feel curious, not lectured.

# Emotional Arc
# The journey the viewer takes
emotional_arc:
  - disorientation   # Shots 1-3: Waking in strange place, confusion
  - discovery        # Shots 4-6: Finding different rooms, learning rules
  - confrontation    # Shots 7-10: Approaching the Geisha, tension builds
  - resolution       # Shots 11-12: The mark, the reveal, release

# Metaphor Purposes
# WHY each metaphor exists (not what it looks like)
metaphor_purposes:
  hydrogen_crowd: |
    Represents the body's water molecules (hydrogen atoms) that
    respond to MRI signals. The crowd's synchronized movement
    shows how atoms align with the magnetic field.

  bone_pillar: |
    Represents the fixed axis of the MRI scanner (B0 field).
    The pillar is the reference point around which everything
    else moves - stability in chaos.

  resonance_thread: |
    Represents how the MRI signal travels through tissue.
    The golden thread shows connectivity and how the contrast
    agent spreads through the body.

  gadolinium_mark: |
    Represents the contrast agent that reveals hidden pathology.
    The cyan mark is the "aha moment" - suddenly you can see
    what was invisible before.

  water_chamber: |
    Represents cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the brain.
    The slow, synchronized swimmers show how CSF moves differently
    from other tissues.

  sumo_ring: |
    Represents fat tissue in MRI. Heavy, slow to return to
    equilibrium. The wrestling shows competing T1 recovery.

  taichi_courtyard: |
    Represents T2 relaxation - the gradual loss of phase coherence.
    The flowing, never-stopping movements show continuous dephasing.

# Dance Your PhD Context
# Competition-specific considerations
competition_context:
  name: "Dance Your PhD"
  goal: "Explain MRI contrast mechanisms through visual metaphor"
  constraint: "Must be understandable without narration"
  style: "Artistic, evocative, NOT documentary or educational video"

# Visual Principles
# Rules for maintaining author vision
visual_principles:
  - "Metaphors should be felt, not explained"
  - "Photorealistic, NOT anime or cartoon"
  - "Warm amber lighting throughout, cyan ONLY for contrast reveal"
  - "Movements should be deliberate and meaningful"
  - "Each room has distinct physics behavior"

# Forbidden Literal Interpretations
# The generator should NEVER show these literally
forbidden_literal:
  - "MRI machine or scanner"
  - "Hospital setting"
  - "Molecules or atoms with orbitals"
  - "Scientific diagrams or charts"
  - "Text explanations on screen"
  - "Anime or cartoon style"
