## One-line style definition
Anime noir in a baroque infinite maze: tatami corridors, shoji walls, lacquered wood, paper light - inside an impossible, shifting architecture. The world is driven by a single rhythmic force (the plucked string), and meaning is created through contrast (reveal/mark), not exposition.

## Mood / emotional tone
- Hypnotic beauty that feels predatory
- Ritual repetition (sound -> tilt -> recovery) as a form of control
- Psychological unease with a clean, elegant surface
- "Reveal through marking": the moment of truth is quiet but decisive

## Core influences
- Infinity Castle (Demon Slayer): spatial infinity, repeating doors, surreal geometry, tatami + shoji, ominous elegance
- Kill Bill: high-contrast graphic language, silhouette frames, hard transitions, ritualized confrontation energy

## Reference Pack (Do/Steal)
- Biwa Demon (Demon Slayer): sound-as-control; diagonal instrument composition; calm menace.
- Infinity Castle wide: establishing scale; amber lantern depth; stacked architecture.
- Upside-down corridor: axis flip as main surreal trick; symmetric corridor; lantern rhythm.
- Stage group shot: theatrical blocking; gold panel backdrop; silhouette readability.
- Sumo: mass/inertia; one-hit sway; grounded motion vs surreal rhythm.
- Kill Bill dojo/stairs: graphic contrast; hard cuts on beat; clean silhouettes.

## Visual pillars (must-haves)
- Infinity architecture: repeating sliding doors, tatami corridors, layered platforms, impossible continuity
- Material authenticity: warm wood, paper screens, ink shadows; avoid "plastic 3D"
- Controlled surrealism: the world shifts via tilt/axis changes rather than complex VFX chaos
- Single motif: the string / shamisen / koto is the world's "demon conductor"

## Color language (meaning-driven)
Base: Ink black / charcoal, warm paper, lacquered wood

Accents:
- Blood red = danger / tumor / lure
- Contrast cyan = gadolinium / reveal / "marked"
- Deep indigo = night depth / castle void

Rule: accents appear only when the story needs emphasis (never as decoration)

## Lighting & texture
- Lantern-like warmth with dense ink shadows
- Shoji paper should read as texture (subtle fiber/grain)
- Wood feels aged and lacquered (soft specular, not glossy plastic)

## Motion language (animation grammar)
The "pluck" is a diegetic beat:

pluck -> micro-pause -> environment tilt/shift -> bodies react -> settle

- Prioritize pose clarity over micro-detail
- "Dance" is minimal: 1-2 simple synchronized steps max
- Magic is shown through geometry + synchronization, not particle overload

## Cinematography / composition rules
- Strong silhouettes; readable shapes
- Repetition (doors, corridors) creates dread and infinity
- Use negative space; avoid clutter
- Hard cuts on plucks; occasional theatrical frontal framing (Kill Bill flavor)

## References (5-10)
- Demon Slayer - Infinity Castle (architecture, menace-beauty, impossible space)
- Kill Bill Vol. 1 (graphic contrast, silhouettes, rhythmic cuts)
- Paprika (Satoshi Kon) (dream logic transitions, surreal coherence)
- Perfect Blue (psychological pressure, clean dread)
- Mononoke (TV series) (stylization, patterns, flat planes with depth)
- Samurai Champloo (music-driven pacing and cutting)
- Ghost in the Shell (1995) (serious tone, dense atmospheres)
- Blade Runner 2049 (color-as-meaning, spacious frames)
- Ukiyo-e prints (pattern, silhouette, controlled palette)
- Kabuki / Noh staging (ritual poses, "freeze" moments)

## Missing references to add next
- Materials close-ups (2-3): shoji paper grain, lacquered wood highlights, clean ink shadow density.
- Enchanted crowd sync (1-2): ritualized synchronized steps without combat chaos.
- Geisha lure with mismatch cue (1): serene pose + minimal gesture + shadow/reflection mismatch hint.

## Anti-references (3-5)
- Pixar/Disney "soft plastic" look and overly rounded cuteness
- Neon cyberpunk as an aesthetic goal (RGB glow overload)
- Hyper-real 3D film rendering with no anime stylization
- Chibi/comedic deformation during dramatic beats
- UI-heavy frames with small readable text or infographics

## "What else fits" (additional inspirations that match)
- Kabuki: bold poses, controlled theatricality
- Noh: stillness, masks, fear through restraint
- Butoh: minimal movement, body control, uncanny calm
- Junji Ito (only as a touch): unsettling "too perfect" moments, not gore

## Figma: Moodboard + Style Tiles + 2-3 key screens
### Moodboard (8-12 images total)
Organize into 4 clusters:
- Infinity Castle Architecture: tatami corridors, repeating doors, layered platforms, impossible angles
- Materials & Textures: shoji paper, ink wash shadows, lacquered wood, kimono fabric patterns
- Lighting & Contrast: lantern warmth vs ink blacks; red accent moments; silhouette frames
- Rhythm Motif: string instrument / fan gestures / synchronized crowd movement / freeze poses

### Style Tiles (1-2 pages)
Include:
- Color chips: Ink/Charcoal/Paper/Wood + Accent Red + Contrast Cyan + Indigo
- Type pairing: cinematic display + clean readable body
- Shape language: sharp-ish rectangles with slight "paper" rounding
- Texture swatches: paper grain, ink bleed, wood lacquer
- Motion notes: "pluck -> pause -> tilt -> stabilize" as the universal beat

### 2-3 Key Screens (so the team sees target look instantly)
- Title Card / Opening
  - Ink-black field, thin string line, minimal red stamp-like mark
- Main Corridor (Doors Infinity)
  - Strong depth, repeating doors, subtle tilt cues, lantern pockets of light
- Geisha Dais / Reveal
  - Central composition, crowd circle, shadow mismatch hint, contrast mark close-up
