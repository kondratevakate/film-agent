  "logline": "A severe Norwegian coach drives packed groups of athletes through ruthless synchronization drills, teaching that T1 is speed of return and T2 is the fading of trauma, until a red verdict reveals she is gadolinium itself-sacrificing to expose a tumor early on MRI.",
  "theme": "What looks like cruelty is diagnostic care in disguise: athletes rotate because MRI sees truth across planes, T1 and T2 become a choreography of recovery, and gadolinium gives itself up so hidden disease can be seen.",
