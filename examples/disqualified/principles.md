## What it should look like
- Ordinary reality before the twist. No science breadcrumbs.
- Cold protocol. Officials deliver decisions without emotion.
- Minimal words. Short, sharp lines; no explanatory voiceover.
- Scandinavian restraint. Clean, sober, unornamented.
- One accent color: red. Use only for verdict/stop moments.

## What we do NOT do
- No sci-fi visualization (no pulses, no x-ray world, no futuristic HUDs).
- No medical melodrama (no crying breakdowns, swelling score, death speeches).
- No sports motivation cliches (no montage rhetoric, no champion speeches).
- No body horror or graphic medical detail.
- No location spam: every new space must add a new story function.

## Quick style checks
- If viewers can guess MRI by 30-40 seconds, it failed.
- If a line can be removed without losing meaning, remove it.
- If a scene does not sharpen "protocol vs human," cut it.
