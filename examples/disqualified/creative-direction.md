## One-line style definition
Clinical social satire in a realistic sports complex: exhausted bodies versus an emotionless pass/fail protocol, culminating in a calm medical reveal that redefines the apparent punishment as life-saving detection.

## Mood
- Tone: grimly entertaining, dry, everyday. Black humor, not parody.
- Pacing: compressed escalation through repeated failure calls and impersonal logging.
- Emotion: not melodrama, but a cold realization punch: "we caught it early."
- World: fully normal sports environment; the ritualized officials are the only systemic oddity.

## Look & feel
- Image language: Scandinavian realism (clean planes, glass/metal, white walls, natural daylight).
- Structural contrast: warm human fatigue versus sterile bureaucratic protocol.
- Color behavior: near-monochrome baseline with rare red accents reserved for verdict/stop/protocol.
- UI/text policy: minimal overlays. If protocol marks appear, keep them abstract (icons/marks), no readable diagnostic UI.

## Narrative devices
- False frame: anti-doping control as the visible interpretation for the officials.
- Ritual repetition: "again / from the top / does not pass" as a pressure rhythm.
- Twist via banality: the doctor line is calm, ordinary, and definitive.

- Black Mirror - "Hang the DJ": recontextualizing twist while the world remains normal.
- Black Mirror - "White Bear": punishment frame that flips meaning at the end.
- Black Mirror - "Nosedive": sterile judgment systems and social discipline.

## Anti-references (avoid)
- Grey's Anatomy style medical melodrama.
- House M.D. style diagnosis monologue puzzle.
- Neon sci-fi / cyberpunk aesthetics.
- Sports motivation cliches (heroic montages, inspirational coach speeches).
- Body horror and graphic medical imagery.

## Mapping (reference -> decision)
- Another Round: ritual that feels normal -> perfection training as social addiction.
- Crocodile: morality-free protocol -> officials remain purely procedural.
- Hang the DJ: meaning flip -> ending stays short, calm, and final.

## Figma deliverables
