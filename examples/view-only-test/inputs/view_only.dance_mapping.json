He lifts an old SLR camera to eye level, angled just upward to catch the first orange-pink rays. Fog lingers below; gentle cold mist; serene natural landscape. Wardrobe and look consistent with early 2000s realism; recurring throughout. Cinematic golden hour lighting, morning hush.",

Ilya sits at the table with Mira and Lev (both muted tones, late 20s-30s), his gaze fixed on his camera aimed at the table, not making eye contact. Steam rises from simple dishes. Mira looks toward him, concern clear. Slightly cluttered but lived-in aesthetic.",

  "style_anchor": "Photorealistic cinematic style with consistent wardrobe and color palette: subdued blues, grays, and natural earth tones; soft morning and evening natural lighting for memory/simulation scenes; harsh, cool high-key white and blue-white clinical lighting for artificial spaces. Reliably realistic skin textures, worn early 2000s clothing, subtle environmental wear. Framing alternates between wide and close-up, keeping depth and separation. Depth of field draws attention to subject, with balanced tonal contrast. No artificial saturation or stylization. Visual reference: the atmosphere and tone of Kieslowski\u2019s \u2018Three Colors: Blue,\u2019 the authentic mood of Tarkovsky\u2019s \u2018Stalker,\u2019 and anchor photography matching reference e1c6ddc2c44af33ef2c61d495fcf02b5d2f56b50bd40f05e40dc9bb610eafe1c. Key attributes: visually grounded, emotionally detached, minimal grain or bloom, anchored in realistic visual cohesion and repeated character costuming throughout."
