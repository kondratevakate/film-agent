# Principles - THE TRACE (Look & Feel)

## What we do
- We shoot the school like a living organism: flows, currents, recovery.
- We let the world explain the rules (light, movement, reaction), not exposition.
- We prioritize motivated light sources (fluorescents, tungsten pockets, emergency red).
- We use composition as storytelling: symmetry = control; drift = confusion.
- We repeat a few visual motifs (overhead flows, macro trace, red alert) instead of adding new gimmicks.
- We keep transitions cinematic (match cuts, audio bridges, rack focus) and invisible.
- We keep the performance tone deadpan and slightly awkward, not gothic noir.
- We preserve an American school pep texture even inside tension beats.

## What we don't do
- No "explainer" voice-over that names the science.
- No glitch/VHS filter spam. Texture is subtle and intentional.
- No glossy, sterile, app-commercial look.
- No fast-cut montage aesthetics; pacing is controlled and readable.
- No over-designed on-screen text; subtitles must be short and legible.
- No full-bleak noir mood that removes the weird playful school energy.

## Subtitles & dialogue rules
- Subtitles are minimal, human, and situational (commands, reactions).
- Avoid slogan lines ("I'm a marker", "I am not a cure").
- The twist is felt through behavior: stain -> fear -> anger -> red light.

## Consistency checks
- Every scene has a distinct space (pool / hallway / gym / studio / old classroom / radiology).
- Pulses escalate logically (minor wobble -> collapse -> visible trace -> alarm state).
- Final cut to radiology is calm and real, not stylized.
