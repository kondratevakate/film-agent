## What the product/film should look and feel like
- Warm anime fantasy baseline: keep the world vivid, textured, and emotionally readable.
- Rhythm first: the pluck is causal, and every environment change obeys that beat.
- Crowd visibility: hydrogen-as-people must be clear in frequent dense group shots.
- Contrast equals meaning: red and cyan exist only for lure, reveal, and diagnosis.
- MRI texture clarity: T1 behavior and contrast effects are represented explicitly in movement choices.
- Geometry is magic: infinity is shown through repeating doors and axis tilt, not VFX noise.
- Silhouette plus expression clarity: poses stay readable and key faces stay legible.
- Menace with hope: threat is real, but the reveal beat must feel like rescue, not nihilism.
- Intruder is unmasked teenage lead energy (original character, no direct IP copy).
- Medical naming is delayed until the final end-card title.
- Athlete rotation around the pillar is purposeful: it visualizes precession around a fixed field axis.

## What we do NOT do
- No cute/rounded "Pixar plastic" vibe.
- No neon cyberpunk glow-fests (RGB as decoration).
- No hyper-real 3D rendering without anime stylization.
- No chibi/comedic deformation during dramatic beats.
- No UI-heavy frames or tiny readable text (avoid infographics).
- No modern elements (no modern clothing, devices, signage, or props).
- No over-crushed black grading that hides faces or crowd behavior.
- Axis flips over VFX: surrealism comes from geometry and tilt, not particle-heavy magic.
- No explicit words "tumor/glioblastoma/опухоль/глиобластома" before end credits.
