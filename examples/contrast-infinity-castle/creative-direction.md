## One-line style definition
Demon Slayer inspired fantasy drama inside Infinity Castle: repeating tatami corridors, warm shoji light, and impossible shifting architecture driven by a plucked string. The tone stays tense but vivid and emotional, not hard noir.

## Mood / emotional tone
- Dreamlike disorientation with readable emotional stakes
- Rhythmic danger followed by collective recovery
- Elegant Japanese fantasy first, menace second
- Reveal through contrast mark, with the medical truth held for the end card

## Core influences
- Infinity Castle (Demon Slayer): surreal scale, shifting doors, layered depth
- Demon Slayer dramatic staging: clear heroic silhouettes, emotionally legible close-ups
- Japanese festival imagery: pillar structures, group movement, ritual energy

## Reference Pack (Do/Steal)
- Biwa Demon references: string-as-control, clean hand gestures, measured menace
- Infinity Castle wide references: stacked architecture and lantern depth
- Corridor axis-shift references: tilt as main surreal device
- Group choreography references: large crowd sway becoming synchronized stability
- Sumo references: heavy-body inertia as fat metaphor
- Festival tower references: vertical support motif as bone metaphor

## Visual pillars (must-haves)
- Infinity architecture: repeating doors, tatami halls, layered platforms, impossible continuity
- Dense human presence: frequent crowd clusters so "hydrogen as people" is always visible
- Material authenticity: warm wood, paper grain, kimono texture; avoid plastic CGI feel
- Controlled surrealism: geometry shifts on pluck beats, not VFX overload
- Single motif: shamisen string as global causal trigger
- MRI factual texture: visual metaphors must map to real scan logic, not random symbolism

## Color language (meaning-driven)
Base: warm paper, lacquered wood, deep indigo voids, controlled ink shadows

Accents:
- Vermilion red = lure, danger, hidden resource sink
- Contrast cyan = gadolinium-contrast mark, reveal, stabilization
- Festival gold = life energy in the crowd

Rule: accents appear only when story beats require them

## Lighting & texture
- Lantern warmth with softer black levels than noir
- Shoji fiber and aged wood must stay tactile in close-ups
- Character faces remain readable even in tense scenes

## Motion language (animation grammar)
The pluck beat is diegetic:

pluck -> micro-pause -> spatial tilt -> crowd sway -> settle

Reveal beat:

intruder enters -> mark appears -> sway becomes synchronized dance -> hidden source exposed

- Prioritize clear posing and directional movement
- Keep magic grounded in geometry and timing
- Do not use explicit medical labels before final credits

## MRI Texture Map (factual)
- `T1 time`: longitudinal recovery time after excitation; shorter T1 returns signal faster.
- Water beat: divers behind glass recover slower between beats (longer-T1 behavior).
- Fat beat: sumo mass rebounds earlier between beats (shorter-T1 behavior).
- Bone beat: tai chi and buddhist athletes rotate around a fixed pillar to show precession around one field axis.
- Why athletes rotate: circular rotation visualizes spin precession and phase behavior before re-alignment.
- Gadolinium beat: the contrast mark shortens local T1 and makes hidden inflow paths brighten.

## Cinematography / composition rules
- Strong but expressive silhouettes, with readable eyes and faces in key close-ups
- Repetition of doors and crowd lanes conveys infinity and resource flow
- Use medium and wide frames to show crowd density, then cut to emotional close-ups
- Hard cuts on plucks; hold briefly on black-screen katana, then readable end-card reveal text

## References (5-10)
- Demon Slayer - Infinity Castle (space language and rhythm danger)
- Demon Slayer climactic reveal scenes (emotional clarity in action)
- Paprika (dream logic transitions)
- Mononoke (patterned stylization and flat-depth tension)
- Samurai Champloo (music-led timing and cuts)
- Kabuki stage compositions (frontal ritual geometry)
- Ukiyo-e prints (shape economy and controlled palette)
- Traditional Japanese matsuri visuals (crowd and pillar motifs)

## Missing references to add next
- High-density human crowd in tatami corridors (2-3)
- Water chamber with divers behind glass under rhythmic pulses (1-2)
- Geisha close-up with panic transition after contrast mark appears (1)
- Minimal black-screen katana transition frame language (1)
- End-card typography on black with short medical reveal sentence (1)

## Anti-references (3-5)
- Overly dark crushed-black noir grading
- Pixar/Disney rounded plastic cuteness
- Neon cyberpunk RGB glow as decoration
- Hyper-real 3D rendering without anime stylization
- UI-heavy frames or tiny readable text overlays

## "What else fits" (additional inspirations that match)
- Kabuki: strong stage geometry and decisive poses
- Noh: stillness and ritual control
- Butoh: controlled off-balance body language
- Taiko ensemble blocking: coordinated group energy without chaos

## Figma: Moodboard + Style Tiles + 2-3 key screens
### Moodboard (8-12 images total)
Organize into 4 clusters:
- Infinity Castle architecture and shifting tatami corridors
- Materials and textures: shoji paper, lacquered wood, kimono fabrics
- Crowd energy language: large human groups, rhythmic sway, synchronized recovery
- Reveal language: contrast mark, geisha panic beat, katana black-screen finish
- End-card reveal language: large readable centered text after action resolves

### Style Tiles (1-2 pages)
Include:
- Color chips: Warm Paper / Wood Brown / Indigo Void / Vermilion / Contrast Cyan / Festival Gold
- Type pairing: dramatic display with clean readable body text
- Shape language: clean rectangles, sliding frames, paper-edge curves
- Texture swatches: paper grain, ink wash edges, lacquer sheen
- Motion notes: "pluck -> tilt -> sway -> stabilize -> reveal"

### 2-3 Key Screens (so the team sees target look instantly)
- Opening Awakening
  - String sound, warm corridor, unmasked Intruder rising in confusion
- Corridor of Doors with Crowd Flow
  - Multiple open doors, many hydrogen people swaying toward one destination
- Geisha Reveal + Surgical End
  - Contrast mark destabilizes the lure, then black-screen katana slash and end-card text
