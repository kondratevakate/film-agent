# Visual Principles — Contrast in the Infinity Castle

## 1. Rhythm Drives Everything
Every visual event must trace back to a rhythm source. The biwa pluck is the prime mover; camera moves, cuts, and crowd motion follow its pulse. No unmotivated action.

## 2. Architecture Over Effects
Express the infinite through **repetition and perspective**, not digital distortion. Stack doors, loop corridors, mirror platforms. The castle's magic is structural, not particle-based.

## 3. Silhouette First
Every character must read as a clear silhouette against their background. If the shape is ambiguous, the shot fails. Theatrical lighting: rim light, gold panels, amber glow.

## 4. Minimal Gesture, Maximum Impact
The Biwa Demon's power comes from economy. A single finger pluck reshapes space. Avoid busy hands, excessive movement. Stillness = control.

## 5. Axis Manipulation
Surreal moments are achieved through **orientation shifts**, not reality-breaking VFX:
- Camera tilts on pluck beats
- Corridor flips (upside-down references)
- Gravity suggested through framing

## 6. Hard Cuts, Graphic Transitions
Transitions sync to rhythm. Prefer hard cuts over dissolves. At climax: full color drain to black/white, katana slash across frame.

## 7. Crowd as Collective Body
The crowd is never chaotic. They move as one organism:
- Synchronized sway during predation
- Unified stance during liberation
- No individual random motion

## 8. Color Discipline
| Phase | Palette |
|-------|---------|
| Predation | Warm amber, gold, deep shadow |
| Tension | Amber + cold blue creep |
| Liberation | Hard black/white, high contrast |

## 9. Mass Obeys Rhythm
Heavy figures (sumo-like bodies) prove the biwa's control force. Even mass sways. One-hit reactions, grounded inertia.

## 10. No Clutter
Every frame must breathe. Remove:
- Unnecessary props
- Competing light sources
- Background noise figures
- Text overlays during action

## Shot Type Distribution
- **Wide establishing**: 15-20%
- **Medium shots**: 40-50%
- **Close-ups**: 25-30%
- **Extreme close-ups**: 10-15%

## Forbidden Patterns
- Jump cuts without rhythm motivation
- Shaky cam / handheld chaos
- Lens flares or light leaks
- Slow-motion unless justified by counter-rhythm moment
- Breaking the 180-degree rule without axis-flip intention
